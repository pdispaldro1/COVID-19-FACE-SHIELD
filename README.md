# base_shield
This is the page for 3D-printable base for a face shield that could be useful for medical purposes during COVID-19 outbreak.
In the repository you can find all the files useful for printing and modifying some dimensional parameters.

This project is fully open source and could be modified whatsoever.
The only things needed to have a fully working mask are following:
1) transparent plastic panels like lexan panels, polycarbonate panels, etc.
2) rubber band for a better comfort in forehead
3) elastic bands to keep tight fit the mask

In the repository there are also some screenshot of how this base fits to a human head.

This device has to work only with FFP2-FFP3 masks, not without it.
