# base_shield
This is the page for 3D-printable base for a face shield that could be useful for medical purposes during COVID-19 outbreak.
In the repository you can find all the files useful for printing and modifying some dimensional parameters.

This project is fully open source and could be modified whatsoever.
The only things needed to have a fully working mask are following:
1) transparent plastic panels like lexan panels, polycarbonate panels, etc.
2) rubber band for a better comfort in forehead
3) elastic bands to keep tight fit the mask

In the repository there are also some screenshot of how this base fits to a human head.

This device has to work only with FFP2-FFP3 masks, not without it.


ADDENDUM: HOW TO BUILD A FACIAL SHIELD

TWO WAYS:

1)Once printed the base, you have to fit the transparent rigid plastic panel towards the base fitting the holes with the spikes.
Once did this, put the rubber band in the forehead contact zone (it's easy to understand what it is, but, in order to be clear, the interested zone is the curved one that has no spikes).
The last thing is to fit the elastic bands to the side holes.

2) With the new 3D-printable band, you have only to print the shield and the cord and join them.


Once finished a working stint, the transparent panel can be replaced with another one.
